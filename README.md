# 5G Energy Consumption Modelling

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on estimating energy consumption in 5G base stations using the '5G-Energy Consumption' dataset provided by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in 2023.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is part of a global data science challenge aimed at addressing the rising energy demands in modern telecommunications. With network operational expenditure (OPEX) making up about 25% of total telecom operator costs — 90% of which is attributed to energy usage — it’s crucial to optimize energy efficiency. Over 70% of this energy is consumed by the Radio Access Network (RAN), especially base stations (BSs).

### Objective

The goal is to build and train a machine learning model capable of estimating the energy consumed by 5G base stations. The model should consider various factors such as:

- Engineering configurations
- Traffic conditions
- Energy-saving techniques
